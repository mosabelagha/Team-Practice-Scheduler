# Directions
1. Use the **EXCEL** document to fill in
  * Team member names
  * Time slots (up to 9)
    * If a time slot is not being used, leave the data for it blank
      * The time slot cell itself can have writing in it
    * If a time slot is being used, fill in data for all cells
  * Team member preferences for time slots
    * 3 = Highly preferable
    * 2 = Preferable
    * 1 = Less preferable
    * 0 = Unavailable
2. Export/Save As to a CSV file
   * When modifying the player info, do it in the excel document then save as CSV again
3. Open Scheduler.jar
4. Click the button when you're ready
   * If you saved the Player Info.csv file as a different name, write the name of the file
5. In the 'output' folder there are multiple results
   * Open 'Recommended.csv' to see the best results
   * The other files are different schedules that you can choose
